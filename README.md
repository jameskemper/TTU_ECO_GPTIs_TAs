#TTU Department of Economics GPTIs and TAs
This repository library includes information for Graduate Part-time Instructors (GPTIs) and Teaching Assistants (TAs) for the Department of Economics at Texas Tech.

###Overview
Currently, the only thing in this repository is a [list of the topics](https://github.com/jameskemper/TTU_ECO_GPTIs_TAs/blob/main/Economics%20Teaching%20Workshop%20topic%20list.pdf) for the weekly Teaching Workshop for GPTIs and TAs. Eventually, a resource library will also contain supplemental materials for teaching economics.
